\f0\fs24 \cf0 This paper presents an interesting work that combines Epigenetic Algorithm with GA for testing software.\
\
The key of Epigenetic Algorithm is that the change of a gene of a solution is controlled by a probability, which in that case is controlled by a learned Transformer based on the environment change.\
\
Basically, the representation of n solutions, each with the dimension and a mask vector. The vector mask controls whether an option in a solution is accessible/changeable during the reproduction. Once it can be changed, it is the changed by a probability predicted by the Transformer.\
\
It looks like the Transformer is trained offline.}
