\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is a DBNS performance bug testing approach, it has some contributions:\
\
1. Build semantically equivalent query to check if any of them is slow, if it does, then there can be a performance bug,\
\
2. This is achieved by two types of query mutation: (1) structural mutations, and (2) expression mutations.\
\
3. Also use the feedback generated query as the seeds for next iteration.}
