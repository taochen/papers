\f0\fs24 \cf0 The paper present a method to generate test case for t-wise testing for software configuration (actually, only 2 and 3 wise).\
\
It uses \
\
1. A scoring to determine which test case to select depending on its coverage contribution to the suit.\
2. A probability update on each option, based on the ratio between true and false configuration in the current test suite. (So only work for binary)\
3. A diversity local search to find valid configuration, according to those that can reduce the dependency violation.}
