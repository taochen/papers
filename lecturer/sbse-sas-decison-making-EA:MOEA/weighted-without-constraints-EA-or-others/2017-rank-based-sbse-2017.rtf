\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is an interesting paper on performance modelling, where it argue that instead of building accurate model, one would only need to rank (a crispy concept) different adaptation solution, which can then guide a search algorithm to optimise the SAS.\
\
\
problem to address: how to determine what level of accuracy is adequate?, as even with the rank, if the model is not accurate, then the rank could be wrong either.}
