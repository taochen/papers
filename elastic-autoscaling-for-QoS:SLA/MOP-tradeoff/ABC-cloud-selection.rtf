\f0\fs24 \cf0 this paper is actually like solving the bi objective selection of workflow problem. It state a way to calculate cost but the QoS (makesspan) is assumed as fixed measured value which is provided by each work node.\
\
It is based on ABC\
\
good \
examples on explaining why ABC?\
\
bad\
no QoS model, no dynamic MOP. it is like service selection problem.\
\
well-balanced solution is selected using weighted-sum}
