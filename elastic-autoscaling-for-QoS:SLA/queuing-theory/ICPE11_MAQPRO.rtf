\f0\fs24 \cf0 This paper use queue model to estimate performance and then providing resource provision\
\
good \
the use of MVA to estimate performance, also consider various tier of impact to performance (additional system activity)\
\
the service completion is always an average value, thus it including additional system activity when load is high so called service demand law. May be a better way to calculate response time\
\
it mainly expose the relation of response time and number of request on a PM\
\
\
bad\
single SLA parameter, no consideration of how much willing to pay. This does not seems like an adaptive approach seem the CI is difficult to find. its QoS model is based on static queue model and simple regression}
