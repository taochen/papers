\f0\fs24 \cf0 This paper propose to use AR to predict the trend of control primitive, and integrate it with kalman filter. it also aim for any QoS\
\
bad\
\
does not consider QoS interference and change of system, also does not seems like fine-grained.\
the control primitives that feed into the model is still fixed and no software control primitives.\
\
the trend prediction on control primitive are purely based on historical data of the same CP, so the correlation between QoS and primitives is still fixed using LQN.\
\
so the prediction in this context is to predict future value of CP or QoS, whereas our prediction means to predict the actual correlation between QoS and primitives.}
