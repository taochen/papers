\f0\fs24 \cf0 this paper uses aco for selecting the nodes in cloud, which is single objective optimisation\
\
this paper does not consider qos at all - its heuristic factor chose the node from load value is larger which implies that the qos could be affected. again, it use an aggregate of all ants for pheromone update which is typical for single objective optimisation.}
