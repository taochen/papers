\f0\fs24 \cf0 This paper present a fuzzy and MIMO based approach for controlling hardware CP allocation. In particular, it distinguish partition able and non-partition able  CPs. their solution is similar to ours - putting all the sensitive CP to predict QoS, and this is the way to cope with interference (VM interference in their context), this is the basic concept of their interference model.\

not fine grained, no cloud dynamics, no when and which, and no software CPs. It does consider VM interference, but due to granularity, it is not service level}
