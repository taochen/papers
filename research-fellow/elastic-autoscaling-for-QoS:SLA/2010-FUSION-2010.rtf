\f0\fs24 \cf0 The paper use primitives (they call it feature) of a system to change its architecture, their QoS modelling is rely on M5 tree which they claim can do dynamic primitives selection, and then a linear regression to train the relation.\
\
these feature could influence both functional and non-functional attribute, and their mapping to the architecture is predefined.\
\
At the plan stage, conflicted objectives are combined as a linear scalarazation and solved via optimisation algorithm. \
\
also it does not consider workload in the model, but use workload as different kind of the model, and thus build different models for a qos\
\
bad\
\
it solve dynamic primitives selection implicitly, but solving it explicitly could future improve the accuracy of learning algorithm. (
\i which
\i0  and 
\i when
\i0  is resolve together with 
\i how
\i0  in the m5 tree)\
\
the model end is still linear regression.\
\
the linear combination of objective could lose many things. \
\
only deal with boolean value of feature not whereas SU can deal with other discrete values\
M5 model tree would also difficult to select features if they are not boolean values.}
