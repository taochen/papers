The paper proposals a hybrid approach that use instance based learning to learn if to use quick (reactive) plan and 
advanced (deliberative) plan toghether or just wati for the advanced plan.

the training is based on offline profiling accroding the the training space that were clustered using response time
and workload. At runtime, the most similar decision making problem to the ones that profiling stage, calculating using
response time and predicted arrival of requests.

bad

the learning process is actually not machine learning but using the model checking way, to create cases to used
at runtime. That is, the generationzation of the approach is questionable
