\f0\fs24 \cf0 The paper compare various seeding strategy for testing on SPL, it mainly focus how to use the seed rather than how to find the seed, the compared ones are:\
\
given some optimised seed,\
\
1) put a fixed number of seed while the other are random, where the seeds are randomly changed.\
2) a single seed with full better result of a particular objective, then change it randomly (on a fixed number).\
3) optimise all seeds according to a single objective\
