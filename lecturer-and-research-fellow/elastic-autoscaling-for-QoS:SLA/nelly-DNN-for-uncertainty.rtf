\f0\fs24 \cf0 Nelly's paper use DDN to model the decision making of self-adaptation, it could be work we our QoS model where our model would be used as reward function, as in their assumption such function is still static.\
\
their evidence (probability of an action could interfere a certain state) is updated at runtime as well, but this does not tell the concert value . Their approach can not cope with conflict objective and trade-off \
\
this is a control based approach.\
\
their approach could focus on higher level e.g., architecture style decision etc.}
