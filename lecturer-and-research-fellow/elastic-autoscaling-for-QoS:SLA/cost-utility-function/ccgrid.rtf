\f0  paper describe an economy way to manning replicate, migrate and stop component regarding the performance of SLA. It mainly concentrate on resource provisioning.\
\
\
good\
view application = component, which does not make any difference in terms of service.\
Adapt a coefficient strategy for load balancing. good point on availability.\
\
bad \
again only focus on response time, availability of SLA, only consider trade-off between utility balance and performance, assume replicate would definitely increase performance so lack of considering consistency. Because it only work on stateless component.\
\
the question about how much resource to allocate is not clear, seems like it intend to allocate the minimum resource for each VM/PM that scale up/down later.\
\
\
its basic approach - vertical-horizontal scaling is the same as ours, we vertical scaling the resource if meet the max capacity, then we horizontal scaling.\
\
\
(this approach could be used in comparison to our sensitivity aware and economy driven trade-off QoS optimisation)}
