\f0\fs24 \cf0 This paper present a cost focused approach that min the cost of cloud consumer, it also consider the reconfiguration costs. It solve the minimising problem by integer linear programming as it is a combinatorial programming problem.\
\
it also propose fixed policy \
\
\
it consider different type of VM\
\
it claim combine vertical and horizontal scaling works better.\
bad\
\
no interference, no QoS model? very typical cost centric. The QoS model is simply the average workload that each VM is able to handle. Which is unclear in terms of QoS.\
\
the problem can only solved by integer linear programming  if the VM type is limited.\
\
\
we think, simply vertical scaling has ignorable cost.}
